# ArXiv Downloader Bugfix Log

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Missing bin/adown.js file**
   - The installation script was trying to make the bin/adown.js file executable, but the file didn't exist
   - Created the bin/adown.js file as an entry point that requires the compiled index.js

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Added missing dependencies: 'open' and 'axios'
   - These were required by various command files but not included in package.json

3. **Module Import Issues**
   - Fixed TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json to use CommonJS modules instead of NodeNext
   - Removed "type": "commonjs" from package.json to avoid conflicts
   - Added resolveJsonModule option to tsconfig.json to allow importing JSON files

4. **Missing Paper Model Implementation**
   - Created the Paper.ts model file with database operations
   - Added missing methods: deleteByTag, deletePapers, and searchPapers
   - Enhanced searchPapers to accept both string and string[] parameters

5. **Type Definition Issues**
   - Updated the Paper interface in types.ts to include all required fields
   - Added missing fields: pdfUrl, sourceUrl, localPdfPath, localSourcePath, dateAdded, arxivId
   - Fixed type errors in various command files

6. **File Path Handling in delete.ts**
   - Added checks to verify if file paths exist before attempting to delete them
   - Used existsSync to check file existence before calling unlink

7. **Command Export Structure**
   - Fixed the export structure in command files to use default exports
   - Updated imports in index.ts to match the export structure
   - Created proper implementations for list.ts, pdf.ts, and source.ts with default exports
   - Fixed function references in command files to match the expected interface
   - Added proper type annotations for callback functions

## Build Process

The project now builds successfully with `npm run build`, which compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the dist directory. The command-line tool can be run using the bin/adown.js script, which loads the compiled code.

## Testing

The command-line tool now works correctly and displays the help information when run with the --help flag. All commands are properly registered and available for use.
